# mTwiddle
This is not really a project but more of an area to twiddle with various little
one file (or almost one file :-)) projects.  To date we have:

* A simple sheet music generator - this was the original "project" for this repo.
I was trying to see how few lines of code I could use to generate a usable, printable
html/css sheet music page.

* A simple 12x12 multiplication table - with colorized rows and columns

* A simple signup sheet.
